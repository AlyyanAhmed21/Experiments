# ML & AI Experiments

Welcome to my **Machine Learning & AI Experiments** repository!  
This repository is a collection of my hands-on experiments, prototypes, and explorations in various areas of AI/ML, conducted primarily in **Google Colab**. It reflects continuous learning, experimentation, and research beyond polished projects.

## Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:

- Document ideas, experiments, and model implementations.
- Showcase learning and exploration in computer vision, NLP, reinforcement learning, and other AI domains.
- Serve as a sandbox for testing new techniques, models, and libraries.
- Keep a record of incremental progress and insights over time.
